# ‚ú® So you want to run an audit

This `README.md` contains a set of checklists for our audit collaboration.

Your audit will use two repos: 
- **an _audit_ repo** (this one), which is used for scoping your audit and for providing information to wardens
- **a _findings_ repo**, where issues are submitted (shared with you after the audit) 

Ultimately, when we launch the audit, this repo will be made public and will contain the smart contracts to be reviewed and all the information needed for audit participants. The findings repo will be made public after the audit report is published and your team has mitigated the identified issues.

Some of the checklists in this doc are for **C4 (üê∫)** and some of them are for **you as the audit sponsor (‚≠êÔ∏è)**.

# Audit setup

## üê∫ C4: Set up repos
- [ ] Create a new private repo named `YYYY-MM-sponsorname` using this repo as a template.
- [ ] Rename this repo to reflect audit date (if applicable)
- [ ] Rename audit H1 below
- [ ] Update pot sizes
  - [ ] Remove the "Bot race findings opt out" section if there's no bot race.
- [ ] Fill in start and end times in audit bullets below
- [ ] Add link to submission form in audit details below
- [ ] Add the information from the scoping form to the "Scoping Details" section at the bottom of this readme.
- [ ] Add matching info to the Code4rena site
- [ ] Add sponsor to this private repo with 'maintain' level access.
- [ ] Send the sponsor contact the url for this repo to follow the instructions below and add contracts here. 
- [ ] Delete this checklist.

# Repo setup

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Add code to this repo

- [ ] Create a PR to this repo with the below changes:
- [ ] Confirm that this repo is a self-contained repository with working commands that will build (at least) all in-scope contracts, and commands that will run tests producing gas reports for the relevant contracts.
- [ ] Please have final versions of contracts and documentation added/updated in this repo **no less than 48 business hours prior to audit start time.**
- [ ] Be prepared for a üö®code freezeüö® for the duration of the audit ‚Äî important because it establishes a level playing field. We want to ensure everyone's looking at the same code, no matter when they look during the audit. (Note: this includes your own repo, since a PR can leak alpha to our wardens!)

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Repo checklist

- [ ] Modify the [Overview](#overview) section of this `README.md` file. Describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the auditors should keep in mind when reviewing. (Here are two well-constructed examples: [Ajna Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna) and [Maia DAO Ecosystem](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-maia))
- [ ] Review the Gas award pool amount, if applicable. This can be adjusted up or down, based on your preference - just flag it for Code4rena staff so we can update the pool totals across all comms channels.
- [ ] Optional: pre-record a high-level overview of your protocol (not just specific smart contract functions). This saves wardens a lot of time wading through documentation.
- [ ] [This checklist in Notion](https://code4rena.notion.site/Key-info-for-Code4rena-sponsors-f60764c4c4574bbf8e7a6dbd72cc49b4#0cafa01e6201462e9f78677a39e09746) provides some best practices for Code4rena audit repos.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Sponsor: Final touches
- [ ] Review and confirm the pull request created by the Scout (technical reviewer) who was assigned to your contest. *Note: any files not listed as "in scope" will be considered out of scope for the purposes of judging, even if the file will be part of the deployed contracts.*
- [ ] Check that images and other files used in this README have been uploaded to the repo as a file and then linked in the README using absolute path (e.g. `https://github.com/code-423n4/yourrepo-url/filepath.png`)
- [ ] Ensure that *all* links and image/file paths in this README use absolute paths, not relative paths
- [ ] Check that all README information is in markdown format (HTML does not render on Code4rena.com)
- [ ] Delete this checklist and all text above the line below when you're ready.

## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
### Areas of Concern

- **SDK Bumps and Interface Changes**
  - Ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK v0.50.x and identify any breaking changes from v0.45.x.
  - Check for updated or deprecated APIs and interfaces in the Cosmos-SDK that may affect current functionality.

- **IBC-go v8 Updates**
  - Verify that inter-blockchain communication (IBC) functionalities remain intact and secure with the new version.
  - Identify any new features or changes in ibc-go v8 that require modifications in the existing implementation.

- **CometBFT v0.38.x Updates**
  - Assess the impact of CometBFT updates on consensus mechanisms and blockchain performance.
  - Evaluate the changes in configuration settings and ensure they are correctly applied during the upgrade.

- **Migration Settings**
  - Ensure that migration scripts and processes are correctly implemented to transition from the older versions to the new versions without data loss or corruption.
  - Validate that state transitions and data migrations do not introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities.

- **Dependencies and Module Updates**
  - Check for any new dependencies introduced with the updates and ensure they are correctly integrated.
  - Review the Ethermint module within Canto for EVM compatibility and assess the changes made to accommodate the new versions of dependencies.
  - Ensure that all external libraries and modules are updated to their compatible versions to prevent any conflicts or security issues.

- **Functionality Testing**
  - Conduct thorough testing of all previously functioning features to confirm they work as expected after the upgrade.
  - Identify any features that malfunction or do not work post-upgrade and determine the root cause.

- **Security Assessment**
  - Perform a security audit to uncover any new vulnerabilities introduced by the upgrades.
  - Ensure that security patches and updates in the new versions are correctly applied to maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

- **Documentation and Support**
  - Update all relevant documentation to reflect the changes and new configurations required for the upgraded versions.
  - Ensure that support teams are informed about the changes and are prepared to handle any issues that may arise from the upgrade.

By focusing on these areas, the audit aims to ensure a smooth transition to the updated versions while maintaining the functionality, performance, and security of the Canto and Ethermint blockchain applications.


### **Background Information**

The current parameters and state of Canto v7 can be reviewed on [Polkachu](https://www.polkachu.com/networks/canto). For details on new and changed parameters, as well as module settings in v8, refer to the v8 upgrade handler code. The primary references for the upgrade include:

- Major changes from [v0.45 to v0.47](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.11/UPGRADING.md) and [v0.47 to v0.50](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/UPGRADING.md).
- The actual differences as seen in the [Canto pull request](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/pull/126/).
- The actual differences as seen in the [Ethermint pull request](https://github.com/Canto-Network/ethermint/pull/2).

### app

- app.go
    - align the overall code with the structure of the cosmos-sdk's [app.go](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/simapp/app.go), except for some parts related canto's modules and issue(ref. [[Discussion] Policy Decision on BlockedAddrs in SDK v0.50 bump #122](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/issues/122))
- ante
    - name change and few other structural changes related to authz and issue(ref. [[Discussion] Use min_commission_rate Instead of ValidatorCommissionDecorator #124](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/issues/124))
- upgrades.go
    - add migration code due to upgrade of cosmos-sdk and ibc-go

### modules

- cli
    - remove legacy REST(ref. [feat!: remove legacy REST cosmos/cosmos-sdk#9594](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9594))
- msgs
    - move `ValidateBasic` logic to msg_server
    - remove funcs like Route, Type, GetSignBytes, GetSigners because they are supported by `protobuf`. But in case of `MsgConvertERC20`, GetSigners func is alive and implemented GetSignersFromMsgConvertERC20V2 func additionally.(ref. [feat: bump up cosmos-sdk v0.50.x, cometbft v0.38.x b-harvest/Canto#53 (comment)](https://github.com/b-harvest/Canto/pull/53#discussion_r1574149712))
    - the module-specific proposal handler and param change was switched to `msg level` so `authority` has been added to the required module.(ref. [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952))
- keeper
    - KVStore has been changed to use `KVStoreService` as opposed to the prev way of accessing KVStore via store key.(ref. [refactor(x/staking)!: KVStoreService, return errors and use context.Context cosmos/cosmos-sdk#16324](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16324), ...)

## NOTE

- `x/onboarding` module is a feature-driven of the `ibc`. So, need to ensure that features don't behave differently compared to canto v7, as the version of the `ibc-go` bump up.
- as the versions of different modules in `go.mod` are upgraded, need to ensure that there are no security issues.

    - the module-specific proposal handler and param change was switched to `msg level` so `authority` has been added to the required module.(ref. [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952))
- keeper
    - KVStore has been changed to use `KVStoreService` as opposed to the prev way of accessing KVStore via store key.(ref. [refactor(x/staking)!: KVStoreService, return errors and use context.Context cosmos/cosmos-sdk#16324](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16324), ...)
