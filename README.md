## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
### Areas of Concern

- **SDK Bumps and Interface Changes**
  - Ensure compatibility with Cosmos-SDK v0.50.x and identify any breaking changes from v0.45.x.
  - Check for updated or deprecated APIs and interfaces in the Cosmos-SDK that may affect current functionality.

- **IBC-go v8 Updates**
  - Verify that inter-blockchain communication (IBC) functionalities remain intact and secure with the new version.
  - Identify any new features or changes in ibc-go v8 that require modifications in the existing implementation.

- **CometBFT v0.38.x Updates**
  - Assess the impact of CometBFT updates on consensus mechanisms and blockchain performance.
  - Evaluate the changes in configuration settings and ensure they are correctly applied during the upgrade.

- **Migration Settings**
  - Ensure that migration scripts and processes are correctly implemented to transition from the older versions to the new versions without data loss or corruption.
  - Validate that state transitions and data migrations do not introduce inconsistencies or vulnerabilities.

- **Dependencies and Module Updates**
  - Check for any new dependencies introduced with the updates and ensure they are correctly integrated.
  - Review the Ethermint module within Canto for EVM compatibility and assess the changes made to accommodate the new versions of dependencies.
  - Ensure that all external libraries and modules are updated to their compatible versions to prevent any conflicts or security issues.

- **Functionality Testing**
  - Conduct thorough testing of all previously functioning features to confirm they work as expected after the upgrade.
  - Identify any features that malfunction or do not work post-upgrade and determine the root cause.

- **Security Assessment**
  - Perform a security audit to uncover any new vulnerabilities introduced by the upgrades.
  - Ensure that security patches and updates in the new versions are correctly applied to maintain the integrity of the blockchain.

- **Documentation and Support**
  - Update all relevant documentation to reflect the changes and new configurations required for the upgraded versions.
  - Ensure that support teams are informed about the changes and are prepared to handle any issues that may arise from the upgrade.

By focusing on these areas, the audit aims to ensure a smooth transition to the updated versions while maintaining the functionality, performance, and security of the Canto and Ethermint blockchain applications.


### **Background Information**

The current parameters and state of Canto v7 can be reviewed on [Polkachu](https://www.polkachu.com/networks/canto). For details on new and changed parameters, as well as module settings in v8, refer to the v8 upgrade handler code. The primary references for the upgrade include:

- Major changes from [v0.45 to v0.47](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.47.11/UPGRADING.md) and [v0.47 to v0.50](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/UPGRADING.md).
- The actual differences as seen in the [Canto pull request](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/pull/126/).
- The actual differences as seen in the [Ethermint pull request](https://github.com/Canto-Network/ethermint/pull/2).

### app

- app.go
    - align the overall code with the structure of the cosmos-sdk's [app.go](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/blob/v0.50.6/simapp/app.go), except for some parts related canto's modules and issue(ref. [[Discussion] Policy Decision on BlockedAddrs in SDK v0.50 bump #122](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/issues/122))
- ante
    - name change and few other structural changes related to authz and issue(ref. [[Discussion] Use min_commission_rate Instead of ValidatorCommissionDecorator #124](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto/issues/124))
- upgrades.go
    - add migration code due to upgrade of cosmos-sdk and ibc-go

### modules

- cli
    - remove legacy REST(ref. [feat!: remove legacy REST cosmos/cosmos-sdk#9594](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9594))
- msgs
    - move `ValidateBasic` logic to msg_server
    - remove funcs like Route, Type, GetSignBytes, GetSigners because they are supported by `protobuf`. But in case of `MsgConvertERC20`, GetSigners func is alive and implemented GetSignersFromMsgConvertERC20V2 func additionally.(ref. [feat: bump up cosmos-sdk v0.50.x, cometbft v0.38.x b-harvest/Canto#53 (comment)](https://github.com/b-harvest/Canto/pull/53#discussion_r1574149712))
    - the module-specific proposal handler and param change was switched to `msg level` so `authority` has been added to the required module.(ref. [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/10952))
- keeper
    - KVStore has been changed to use `KVStoreService` as opposed to the prev way of accessing KVStore via store key.(ref. [refactor(x/staking)!: KVStoreService, return errors and use context.Context cosmos/cosmos-sdk#16324](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16324), ...)

## NOTE

- `x/onboarding` module is a feature-driven of the `ibc`. So, need to ensure that features don't behave differently compared to canto v7, as the version of the `ibc-go` bump up.
- as the versions of different modules in `go.mod` are upgraded, need to ensure that there are no security issues.

# Ethermint

### rpc

- as go-ethereum versions go up, the implementation of funcs used internally may have changed

### modules

- cli
    - remove legacy REST(ref. [feat!: remove legacy REST cosmos/cosmos-sdk#9594](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/9594))
    - introduce `autocli`, so removes contents of tx.go, query.go
- msgs
    - move `ValidateBasic` logic to msg_server
    - remove funcs like Route, Type, GetSignBytes, GetSigners because they are supported by `protobuf`. But in case of `MsgEthereumTx`, GetSigners func is alive and implemented GetSignersFromMsgEthereumTxV2 func additionally.(ref.
