hi everyone
2 questions to c4 and organizers
1. Did you exclude module logic code on purpose from the scope? say there's a bug in csr/keeper/csr.go or some other file related to the module NOT in scope -- will it still be accepted as a valid issue?
2. Given how large the scope is I suggest we give wardens some extra time by extending the competition by 3 days, i.e set the new deadline to 24 Jun 12:00 AM GMT+4.

What do you think?

As described in [README.md](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-canto) KVStore has been changed to use `KVStoreService` as opposed to the prev way of accessing KVStore via store key.(ref. [refactor(x/staking)!: KVStoreService, return errors and use context.Context cosmos/cosmos-sdk#16324](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/pull/16324), ...)

In the case of csr.go, it was excluded to reduce the vast code review scope because only the way to use the store has changed and there is no change in the actual logic. If there is a bug in the part using the newly introduced KVStoreService, this can also be seen as a valid issue.

@CloudEllie `FYI` be aware that the section `Overview of Changes` appears twice in the contest page, that's not important per say, just a minor FYI.


[06/17/2024 15:13] itsmetechjay
thanks for the flag - we'll take a look!  cc: @kartoonjoy | C4🎇🎇 @KnownFact

Hey, Is it possible to extend the competition as @honeymewn  suggested?


[06/17/2024 21:37] kartoonjoy
It's a very low likelihood that this audit would be extended. Please just do your best to identify meaningful findings.

hi. i'm fairly new to code4rena. how do i know the status of my submissions? thanks


[06/28/2024 18:25] dontonka
you can't as you don't have SR (aka Backstage role) so you don't have access to the repo. you will just have a nice or very odd surprise when the results come in in few weeks.


[06/28/2024 18:31] dontonka
@honeygem I just checked your reports, which are rather very small 😅 . Out of the 4, only one did make it to the finding repo only (the GovShuttle related) and has been downgraded to QA.

hey guys, any news on the current status of the audit?


[07/03/2024 08:54] varun2791
It's in PJQA

thanks

Hi. I'm new to code4rena and while I'm impressed by judging speed I have a question -- Why are issues closed here without any comments? I find it quite disrespectful to wardens and it hasn't happened on other platforms I've participated. Now, I'm sitting wondering whether they even read the reports.

@kt_nowk  , @fates  , @dudong2


[07/05/2024 11:20] _3doc_
That seems strange, I usually comment issues before closing so people can review the decision. Exception to that are the issues that become duplicate. Which issue(s) are you referring to?


[07/05/2024 11:21] honeymewn
I'll dm you. I would have no way of knowing it if a friend didn't send me screenshots.


[07/05/2024 11:22] _3doc_
Ok. There’s also the case of findings that didn’t pass validation. I can provide explanations in DM but please know that the time for escalations is over so all we can do is informing


[07/05/2024 11:23] honeymewn
@3DOC appreciate it but this one wasn't announced here either which I find ridiculous


[07/05/2024 11:24] _3doc_
In C4 not everyone can escalate, you need the SR role and once you have that you are invited to the channel where these are announced


[07/05/2024 11:25] honeymewn
I could have escalated through a friend if I knew beforehand.
